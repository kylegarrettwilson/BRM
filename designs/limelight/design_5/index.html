            <p>
                The days of cluttered, multi-paged websites are going in the same direction as parachute pants and floppy
                disks: extinct.  There is a massive push by users to experience clean websites that do not overwhelm them
                with tacky colors and flashing banners. As the population experiences more and more saturation with advertisements,
                it is becoming increasingly important to grab the customer’s attention upon the first click to your website.
                The way BRM approaches this changing digital environment is by building large images near the top of the page,
                which help to visually display what the business is about at first glance; this aids with both brand
                recognition and helps you stand out from competitors. We also utilize techniques that help direct the
                users’ sight through the use of smooth animations and photo galleries. It is important to balance the
                website visually by mixing use of the content and image to ensure that one does not overshadow the other.
                Many of our designs use section headers that are accompanied by visual queues, such as word art, to help
                the user quickly find the information they are wanting.  At BRM, we aim to ensure that the content of
                your website is displayed in a neat and orderly fashion, making it both appealing and easy to gather
                needed information for the customer.

            <h2>Usability Test Results</h2>

            <article>
                <p>
                    Usability testing is a critical step in the web design process. The main disciplines that BRM aims
                    to test are learnability and efficiency. Learnability is how easy it is for a new user to accomplish
                    tasks the first time they visit your site. Efficiency is how quickly users can complete tasks on your
                    site after they familiarize themselves with its use. The reason these two user interactions (UI) are
                    so important is because people will go to the next site if the first site they visit is not usable or
                    cannot be quickly be understood. Your business can have the most beautiful website in the world, but
                    people will leave immediately if they are unable to figure out how to navigate your site quickly. BRM
                    focuses on providing designs that are able to adapt the view of the website to the screen size of the
                    user’s device to aid in the website’s ease of use across devices.
